Part 1: Reading the Nucleon Form Factors\n","\n","### 1.1 Physics Background and Motivations\n","\n","Within the Standard Model of particle physics, nucleons (protons and neutrons), the constituents of atomic nuclei, are complex structures composed of quarks and gluons.\n","Their interactions are governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), making nucleon structure a direct and intricate result of quark-gluon dynamics.\n","Nucleon form factors serve as powerful tools for probing this structure.\n","Despite significant theoretical and experimental efforts, several unresolved issues and inconsistencies remain regarding the fundamental properties of nucleons.\n","\n","Experiments studying electron scattering off protons and neutrons have a long history of providing an understanding of the structure of nucleons.\n","Quantitative understanding of the distribution of charge is described by the electric and magnetic form factors, $G_E$ and $G_M$.\n","One key issue that the physics community is looking into is the behavior of the ratio $G_E/G_M$ (a more direct product of experimental measurements, such as those from Jefferson Lab) at $Q^2 > 1\\text{ GeV}^2$.\n","Also, where does this ratio cross zero;\n","is it at about $8\\text{ GeV}^2$ as indicated by experiments at JLab?\n","What picture can give us better intuition to understand why?\n","\n","The behavior of nucleon electromagnetic form factors at high momentum transfer also has implications for understanding and improving models of nucleon structure.\n","QCD models such as \"vector-meson dominance\", \"chiral solitons\", \"Dyson-Schwinger and Faddeev equations\", \"relativistic constituent quarks\" and more, have been employed to predict form-factor behavior but their predictions differ in the region where data are unavailable.\n","Methods, such nonperturbative lattice-QCD calculations, can be used to determine their magnitude and make predictions for upcoming experimental measurements.\n","For those who are interested in learning more on this topic, see [this reference](https://doi.org/10.1140/epja/i2015-15079-x) for a review.\n","\n","Many lattice-QCD collaborations are interested in the nucleon electromagnetic form factors with respect to the nucleon radius, focusing on the small momentum transfer region of the form factors.\n","The electric (magnetic) charge radii of the nucleons can be obtained from the slope of the form factors at spacelike squared four-momentum transfer $Q^2=0$.\n","At present there is a $6\\sigma$ discrepancy between the electric charge radius of the proton obtained from electronic energy levels combined with electron scattering data versus that from the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen $E_{\\mu p}(2S-2P)$.\n","For those who are interested in finding out more about the \"proton-radius puzzle\", you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv7j9EtmQzE) to learn more and about how this topic is connected to atomic spectroscopy.\n","\n","Another major focus of form-factor study is the nucleon axial form factors.\n","Understanding nucleon axial form factors is essential to predicting how nucleons respond to weak interactions, a key aspect of neutrino scattering.\n","These form factors are critical for interpreting data from current and future neutrino experiments like NO$\\nu$A, MINER$\\nu$A, and DUNE, especially at Fermilab where MINER$\\nu$A has recently released new neutrino-interaction measurements.\n","While the axial charge, $g_A$, is precisely known from experiments on neutron beta decay, the momentum dependence of the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ and the induced-pseudoscalar form factor $G_P(Q^2)$ remain less precisely determined by experimental data.\n","Due to the limited time, we will focus on the topic of nucleon electromagnetic form factors.\n","However, the analysis technique you learned in this unit can be easily extend to axial form factor as well.\n","The axial current form factors of the nucleon and nuclei are relevant for neutrino physics as discussed extensively in the [USQCD whitepaper on lattice QCD for neutrino physics](https://doi.org/10.1140/epja/i2019-12916-x).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Task 1.1\n","What other form factors are lattice-QCD collaborations studying?\n","What is their
