1.Download the MILC code

git clone https://github.com/milc-qcd/milc_qcd

2.Change directory

cd milc_qcd

3.Switch to the 'develop' branch (the most up-to-date)

git checkout develop

4.Change directory to the SU(3) pure gauge application

cd pure_gauge

5.Copy the standard Makefile into the application directory

cp ../Makefile ./

6.Makefile contains platform-dependent options, it does not contain actual build targets. Edit the Makefile to reflect your platform, operating system and C/C++ compiler

For Alexei Bazavov's Mac set up the change is

    MY_CC  ?= gcc-8
    MY_CXX ?= g++-8

to 

    MY_CC  ?= gcc-mp-10
    MY_CXX ?= g++-mp-10

7.There are common functions in ../libraries directory whose compilation is governed by their own makefile. In our case (scalar, no MPI) it is ../libraries/Make_vanilla . This file should have the compiler set to the same one as in the application directory.

For Alexei Bazavov's Mac set up the change is 

else ifeq ($(strip ${COMPILER}),gnu)
  CC = gcc

to

else ifeq ($(strip ${COMPILER}),gnu)
	CC = gcc-mp-10

8.The available targets in 'pure_gauge' are in the Make_template. We are interested in 'su3_ora' -- this is SU(3) pure gauge updating with heatbath + overrelaxation. Build the target

make su3_ora

(The first build is lengthier than next builds because it compiles the auxiliary functions in ../libraries.)

9.This executable can be run as

./su3_ora <input_file> <output_file>

or

./su3_ora <input_file> > <output_file>

10.In the application directory 'pure_gauge' there is a 'test' directory (as in most of the application directories). One can check if the code was built correctly, for instance, by running 'su3_ora' executable with the input file

test/su3_ora.2.sample-in

and storing the output in a new file 'my_test' and then comparing 'my_test' with

su3_ora.2.sample-out
