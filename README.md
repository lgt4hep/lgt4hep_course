## Course Information Sheet

Welcome to the LGT4HEP Traineeship Course (Fall 2024/Spring 2025). Below is the information sheet for the course (continuously updated):

The course consists of several modules each semester, as listed below. Each module may run for one, two, or three weeks, depending on the topic. Each week consists of two sessions. Each session consists of a one-hour lecture presented by the designated student lecturer. Each session also includes a half-an-hour discussion and Q/A slot involving student lecturers, expert faculty assigned to the module, and other students in the class.

A team of students will be in charge of preparing, presenting, and distributing a set of lecture notes on the topic of each module. The number of team members depends on the length of the module. For example, a two-week module will require 4 student lecturers to work together to prepare the content of the lectures. Each of the four students will present one of the lectures in class. The team formations and module assignments will be conducted prior to the start of the course.

For students who are doing the student-led lectures:
1. the student team meets with the expert faculty assigned to the module three times. The first meeting happens two weeks prior to the start of the module so the expert faculty can advise on the resources the students should study and the content they should cover. The second meeting occurs one week before the start of the module so the expert faculty can be updated on the progress in lecture development, to provide timely feedback, and to answer any technical questions regarding the content of the module. The final meeting between expert faculty and student team happens the week after the end of the module to provide feedback on lecture contents and delivery.
2. Student team assigned to each module should work together closely throughout the preparation period to develop unified and coherent lectures on the topic. If the subject area is too unfamiliar, the students need to start earlier but two weeks of committed time is a minimum. Depending on the number of students enrolled in the class, each student will be assigned to present at least one lecture and at most two lectures (in two different modules) per semester.
3. Students are encouraged to write logically coherent, notationally clean, and legible and structured notes to share with their peers as a valuable resource. The notes can be handwritten but latexed versions are preferred. These notes should be distributed no later than a week after the delivery of the lectures.
4. Students are encouraged to identify problems that can be assigned as homework problems within lecture notes. These could be derivations that can not fit the class time, further examples to demonstrate a point, etc.
5. The lectures can be presented on a (virtual) blackboard, with the possibility of presenting a few slides when certain plots or graphics need to be displayed. If you do not own an iPad or similar device to present the lectures, talk to your local faculty expert.

There will be a semester projects and presentation for those students who does not participate the student-led lectures. The students are encouraged to form team to work on the project, starting from roughly mid-point of the lecture schedule, and aim to complete on the last week of the class.
