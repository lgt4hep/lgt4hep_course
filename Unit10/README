## LGT4HEP_2pt.h5
Here is a data set to use for the problem at the end of the second video (for Day02's lecture). 
If you want to use mathematica to do the exercise, read the data with
Import["LGT4HEP_2pt.h5", "2pt", "ComplexKeys" -> {"re", "im"}]
In python you might do something like
import h5py
import numpy as np
f = h5py.File ("LGT4HEP_2pt.h5", 'r')
g = np.zeros (shape = (2, 2, 21, 518), dtype = np.complex128)
for a in range (2) :
    for b in range (2) :
        for c in range (21) :
            for d in range (518) :
                g[a, b, c, d] =  f['2pt'][a, b, c, d][0] + (1j)*f['2pt'][a, b, c, d][1]
